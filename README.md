This Battle Rez Tracker is a lightweight addon designed for World of Warcraft (2026) to provide a clear, high-visibility icon for tracking battle resurrection charges and recharge times in challenging content. It integrates directly with the Blizzard Edit Mode, allowing for seamless placement and scaling.

### **Description**

Battle Rez Tracker (BRT) displays a square icon featuring the Rebirth spell artwork. It remains hidden during solo play and automatically appears when you enter a **Raid**, **Mythic+ Dungeon**, or **Delve**. The addon provides:

*   **Charge Tracking**: A numeric display of available battle resurrection charges.
*   **Recharge Timer**: A countdown timer showing exactly when the next charge will become available.
*   **Visual Feedback**: The icon desaturates (turns grey) when no charges are available to let you know at a glance that a rez is not possible.
*   **Edit Mode Support**: Fully movable and resizable using Blizzard's native Edit Mode interface.

### **Positioning and scaling**

*   **Move the Tracker**: Open the game menu and select **Edit Mode**. Click and drag the Battle Rez Tracker icon to your preferred location.
*   **Resize the Tracker**: While in **Edit Mode**, hover your mouse over the tracker and use the **Mouse Wheel** to scale it up or down. The tracker will grow or shrink in place without moving from its position.
*   **Save Changes**: Click **Save** in the Blizzard Edit Mode window to lock your new position and scale.

### **Slash Commands**

You can use `/brt` or `/battlereztracker` followed by these commands:

*   `/brt reset`: Teleports the tracker back to the center of your screen and resets its scale to 100% (use this if the icon gets lost off-screen).
*   `/brt test`: Toggles "Test Mode" so you can see the tracker and customize it while standing in a city or solo.
*   `/brt count #`: Sets the number of charges to display during Test Mode (e.g., `/brt count 2`).
*   `/brt timer #`: Sets the seconds remaining on the recharge timer during Test Mode (e.g., `/brt timer 300`).
